Previously, FILE origins were getting lost in the GetPlugins, since WebSecurityOrigin serializes FILE origins to &quotnull&quot.\n\nThis meant that content settings exceptions did not work correctly for the plugin list retrieval. This didn't matter before HBD because the plugin list wasn't affected by content settings until HBD.\n\nThis patch fixes it by passing url::Origin throughout the Plugins code rather than GURL for the

We achieve this in the sandbox code by adding a function which generates the appropriate sandbox syntax.\n\nThis CL also contains unit tests for the above functionality and re-enables it [bug 56765, the underlying issue appears to be unrelated to the test and previously fixed].\n\nBUG=42989, 56765\nTEST=Chrome should continue to render web pages correctly, installing extensions and themes should continue to work on OS X.\n\nReview URL: http://codereview.chromium.org/4044002\n\ngit-svn-id: svn://svn.chromium.org/chrome/trunk/src@63884 0039d316-1c4b-4281-b951-d872f2087c98","insertions":43,"deletions":150,"churn":193,"filepaths":{"chrome/browser/utility.sb":{"insertions":1,"deletions":1},"chrome/common/common.sb":{"insertions":6,"deletions":4},"chrome/common/sandbox_mac.mm":{"insertions":21,"deletions":79},"chrome/common/sandbox_mac_diraccess_unittest.mm":{"insertions":11,"deletions":62},"chrome/renderer/renderer.sb":{"insertions":4,"deletions":4}}},"":{},"a6d7ae5e4b8ab5b72c1e6dd59809c13369e51df2":{"commit":"a6d7ae5e4b8ab5b72c1e6dd59809c13369e51df2","author":"inferno@chromium.org","email":"inferno@chromium.org@0039d316-1c4b-4281-b951-d872f2087c98","date":"2011-01-06 15:39:33 -0500","message":"Turn the volume range check into a bail out return to prevent browser crash.\n\nBUG=68244\nTEST=None\n\nReview URL: http://codereview.chromium.org/6133001\n\ngit-svn-id: svn://svn.chromium.org/chrome/trunk/src@70635 0039d316-1c4b-4281-b951-d872f2087c98","insertions":5,"deletions":8,"churn":13,"filepaths":{"chrome/browser/renderer_host/audio_renderer_host.cc":{"insertions":2,"deletions":3},"media/audio/audio_util.cc":{"insertions":3,"deletions":5}}},"9c619e4daf10b27b6c561c3f09512e7237175eb6":{"commit":"9c619e4daf10b27b6c561c3f09512e7237175eb6","author":"cevans@chromium.org","email":"cevans@chromium.org@0039d316-1c4b-4281-b951-d872f2087c98","date":"2011-01-12 21:14:42 -0500","message":"Avoid a possible race between entry deletion and a command, in the event a\nrenderer was sending out-of-order messages.\n\nBUG=69195\nTEST=media\n\nReview URL: http://codereview.chromium.org/6227003\n\ngit-svn-id: svn://svn.chromium.org/chrome/trunk/src@71286 0039d316-1c4b-4281-b951-d872f2087c98","insertions":2,"deletions":2,"churn":4,"filepaths":{"chrome/browser/renderer_host/audio_renderer_host.cc":{"insertions":2,"deletions":2}}},"b9866ebc631655c593a2ac60a3c7cf7d217ccf5d":{"commit":"b9866ebc631655c593a2ac60a3c7cf7d217ccf5d","author":"cevans@chromium.org","email":"cevans@chromium.org@0039d316-1c4b-4281-b951-d872f2087c98","date":"2011-01-12 14:20:01 -0500","message":"Use the lock when accessing the buffer object.\n\nBUG=69195\nTEST=play Z-Type for hours :)\n\nReview URL: http://codereview.chromium.org/6157007\n\ngit-svn-id: svn://svn.chromium.org/chrome/trunk/src@71211 0039d316-1c4b-4281-b951-d872f2087c98","insertions":0,"deletions":1,"churn":1,"filepaths":{"media/audio/audio_output_controller.cc":{"insertions":0,"deletions":1}}},"ea889ae0f3e6fb9902b5be7c5dd9ff8fa0e522e9":{"commit":"ea889ae0f3e6fb9902b5be7c5dd9ff8fa0e522e9","author":"creis@google.com","email":"creis@google.com@0039d316-1c4b-4281-b951-d872f2087c98","date":"2011-02-04 14:21:44 -0500","message":"Fix test_shell to use the correct page ID for error pages.\n\nBUG=70315\nTEST=Go back to a &quotconfirm form resubmission&quot error, then forward.\n\nReview URL: http://codereview.chromium.org/6286100\n\ngit-svn-id: svn://svn.chromium.org/chrome/trunk/src@73827 0039d316-1c4b-4281-b951-d872f2087c98","insertions":0,"deletions":8,"churn":8,"filepaths":{"webkit/tools/test_shell/test_webview_delegate.cc":{"insertions":0,"deletions":8}}},"594d06257a0772468c847d35299fe84f2272c496":{"commit":"594d06257a0772468c847d35299fe84f2272c496","author":"aa@chromium.org","email":"aa@chromium.org@0039d316-1c4b-4281-b951-d872f2087c98","date":"2010-12-07 00:33:07 -0500","message":"It turns out the Cleanup() method in JsModalDialog is not\nneeded.

feature pages will continue to work, they just\nwill not be able to get speech input via <input> controls\nvia these APIs and will either have to use the standard\nWeb Speech APIs or depend on the operating system to expose\nspeech input via other methods.\n\nI've verified that disabling this does not affect the new\nJS Web Speech API by testing with:\nhttps://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/demos/speech.html\n\nBUG=360448\n\nCommitted: https://src.chromium.org/viewvc/blink?view=rev&revision=171187\n\nReview URL:

Thus, it is now possible to\nattach a *new* Document with a synchronous navigation while the old\nDocument is being detached.\n\nBUG=546545\n\nReview URL: https://codereview.chromium.org/1444183003\n\nCr-Commit-Position: refs/heads/master@{#360190}","insertions":34,"deletions":47,"churn":81,"filepaths":{"third_party/WebKit/Source/core/dom/Document.cpp":{"insertions":0,"deletions":10},"third_party/WebKit/Source/core/frame/LocalFrame.cpp":{"insertions":0,"deletions":14},"third_party/WebKit/Source/core/frame/LocalFrame.h":{"insertions":2,"deletions":20},"third_party/WebKit/Source/core/loader/FrameLoader.cpp":{"insertions":1,"deletions":1},"third_party/WebKit/Source/core/loader/NavigationScheduler.cpp":{"insertions":14,"deletions":2},"third_party/WebKit/Source/core/loader/NavigationScheduler.h":{"insertions":17,"deletions":0}}},"4026d85fcded8c4ee5113cb1bd1a7e8149e03827":{"commit":"4026d85fcded8c4ee5113cb1bd1a7e8149e03827","author":"meacer","email":"meacer@chromium.org","date":"2015-10-30 18:12:48 -0400","message":"Cache all chrome.loadTimes info before passing them to setters.\n\nThe setters can invalidate the pointers frame, data_source and document_state.\n\nBUG=549251\n\nReview URL: https://codereview.chromium.org/1422753007\n\nCr-Commit-Position: refs/heads/master@{#357201}","insertions":64,"deletions":66,"churn":130,"filepaths":{"chrome/renderer/loadtimes_extension_bindings.cc":{"insertions":64,"deletions":66}}},"e7df2d7d0c7a185834722cea42589caefd44da96":{"commit":"e7df2d7d0c7a185834722cea42589caefd44da96","author":"thestig","email":"thestig@chromium.org","date":"2015-10-13 20:11:11 -0400","message":"Roll PDFium 3acb1ef..24c1eec\n\nhttps://pdfium.googlesource.com/pdfium.git/+log/3acb1ef..24c1eec\n\nBUG=457480,497355\nTBR=tsepez@chromium.org\n\nReview URL: https://codereview.chromium.org/1397173005\n\nCr-Commit-Position: refs/heads/master@{#353919}","insertions":1,"deletions":1,"churn":2,"filepaths":{"DEPS":{"insertions":1,"deletions":1}}},"eb4d5d9ab41449b79fcf6f84d8983be2b12bd490":{"commit":"eb4d5d9ab41449b79fcf6f84d8983be2b12bd490","author":"ochang","email":"ochang@chromium.org","date":"2015-10-21 01:33:04 -0400","message":"Fix an optimisation in ContainerNode::notifyNodeInsertedInternal\n\nR=tkent@chromium.org\nBUG=544020\n\nReview URL: https://codereview.chromium.org/1420653003\n\nCr-Commit-Position: refs/heads/master@{#355240}","insertions":3,"deletions":26,"churn":29,"filepaths":{"third_party/WebKit/LayoutTests/fast/forms/week-multiple-fields/week-multiple-fields-no-shadow-event-expected.txt":{"insertions":0,"deletions":5},"third_party/WebKit/LayoutTests/fast/forms/week-multiple-fields/week-multiple-fields-no-shadow-event.html":{"insertions":0,"deletions":18},"third_party/WebKit/Source/core/dom/ContainerNode.cpp":{"insertions":2,"deletions":2},"third_party/WebKit/Source/core/dom/Element.h":{"insertions":1,"deletions":1}}},"1ef74c77625095af2d15ef993859b93157750447":{"commit":"1ef74c77625095af2d15ef993859b93157750447","author":"thestig","email":"thestig@chromium.org","date":"2015-10-09 18:22:20 -0400","message":"Roll PDFium a398ca6..3acb1ef\n\nhttps://pdfium.googlesource.com/pdfium.git/+log/a398ca6..3acb1ef\n\nBUG=497357,541323,514891\nTBR=tsepez@chromium.org\n\nReview URL: https://codereview.chromium.org/1403563002\n\nCr-Commit-Position: refs/heads/master@{#353405}","insertions":1,"deletions":1,"churn":2,"filepaths":{"DEPS":{"insertions":1,"deletions":1}}},"3acb1ef909a22368507ed13817c4988c818e3aee":{},"1eefa26e1795192c5a347a1e1e7a99e88c47f9c4":{"commit":"1eefa26e1795192c5a347a1e1e7a99e88c47f9c4","author":"paulmeyer","email":"paulmeyer@chromium.org","date":"2015-09-30 22:11:13 -0400","message":"This patch implements a mechanism for more granular link URL permissions (filtering on scheme/host).

It should not be used internally for generating random numbers in Blink.\n\nThe way cryptographically random number generation worked in Blink prior to this patch is that wtf::cryptographicallyRandomValues() would generate random bytes using an ARC4 keystream. Every 1.6MB of generated data it would stir in randomness obtained via Platform::current()->cryptographicallyRandomValues().\n\nThe way it works after this patchset is that wtf::cryptographicallyRandomValues() directly calls Platform::current()->cryptographicallyRandomValues(), without layering on its own PRNG. The concrete implementation of Platform::cryptographicallyRandomValues() now calls crypto::RandBytes() [1], which provides good cryptographically secure random numbers by reading from hardware/system randomness sources.\n\nThe consequences of this change are:\n\n * The fixed sequence of random numbers seen by certain tests will have changed. I haven't observed this to be a problem with any of the tests though.\n\n * The performance characteristics of cryptographicallyRandomValues() have changed, for the worse. Measured using a microbenchmark, window.crypto.getRandomValues() is almost 5x slower now. This is not all that surprising since RC4 was pretty fast, and was only mixing in system randomness every 1.6MB (my test generated 256MB).\n\n[1] Technically it is calling base::RandBytes(), but under the hood that calls crypto::RandBytes(). Will fix that dependency separately.\n\nBUG=552749\n\nReview URL: https://codereview.chromium.org/1431233002\n\nCr-Commit-Position:

Consequently, extension code\n(content scripts, chrome.app.window.create) that run arbitrary code in the\n&quotdocument element created&quot and &quotdocument loaded&quot notifications may result in\nunexpected invalidation of memory, resulting in a UAF.\n\nThis patch fixes the bug by moving all code that runs untrusted code from\nobservers to dedicated callbacks, which are only run at a safe point.\nAll document parsers in Blink have been modified to make sure that they still\nwork even when the document creation is interrupted by frame removal.\n\nAn extensive set of tests for all different kinds of documents, frame removal\nmethods (e.g. synchronously / in mutation events / ...) and injection points\n(document start/end) have been added to avoid

Click a link to c.com in both windows.\n\nBecause browser-initiated navigations go cross-process but\nrenderer-initiated navigations do not [1], the two c.com windows will\nend up in different renderer processes.\n\nBoth windows have the same origin but see each other as RemoteFrames.\nThis means that SecurityOrigin's canAccess check will pass��� but this\nends up violating many assumptions in Blink that passing the security\ncheck implies a local frame.\n\n[1] https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/process-models#Caveats\n\nBUG=601629\nCQ_INCLUDE_TRYBOTS=tryserver.chromium.linux:linux_site_isolation\n\nReview URL: https://codereview.chromium.org/1887553002\n\nCr-Commit-Position: refs/heads/master@{#387087}","insertions":3,"deletions":85,"churn":88,"filepaths":{"content/browser/frame_host/render_frame_host_manager_browsertest.cc":{"insertions":0,"deletions":71},"third_party/WebKit/Source/bindings/core/v8/BindingSecurity.cpp":{"insertions":2,"deletions":10},"third_party/WebKit/Source/core/frame/DOMWindow.cpp":{"insertions":1,"deletions":4}}},"34c97b31e61e8329e19188b46a489412a16d2b63":{"commit":"34c97b31e61e8329e19188b46a489412a16d2b63","author":"jochen","email":"jochen@chromium.org","date":"2016-04-15 08:03:12 -0400","message":"Don't execute the fallback if we already started running the gc callback\n\nBUG=603732\nR=vogelheim@chromium.org\n\nReview URL: https://codereview.chromium.org/1887423002\n\nCr-Commit-Position: refs/heads/master@{#387578}","insertions":2,"deletions":5,"churn":7,"filepaths":{"extensions/renderer/gc_callback.cc":{"insertions":2,"deletions":5}}},"2400ef7b592c31c9883fd1cd60bdea0622e69db3":{"commit":"2400ef7b592c31c9883fd1cd60bdea0622e69db3","author":"jochen","email":"jochen@chromium.org","date":"2016-04-21 04:14:57 -0400","message":"When we can't neuter ArrayBuffers, we can't transfer them\n\nInstead, we need to copy\n\nBUG=603987\nR=haraken@chromium.org\n\nReview URL: https://codereview.chromium.org/1904913002\n\nCr-Commit-Position: refs/heads/master@{#388719}","insertions":1,"deletions":1,"churn":2,"filepaths":{"third_party/WebKit/Source/bindings/core/v8/SerializedScriptValue.cpp":{"insertions":1,"deletions":1}}},"82500315884357312b3caafb49d347ef011c296f":{"commit":"82500315884357312b3caafb49d347ef011c296f","author":"creis","email":"creis@chromium.org","date":"2016-04-12 15:56:03 -0400","message":"Fix HistoryEntry corruption when commit isn't for provisional entry (try #2).\n\nBUG=597322, 600238\nTEST=See bug for repro steps.\nCQ_INCLUDE_TRYBOTS=tryserver.chromium.linux:linux_site_isolation\n\nReview URL: https://codereview.chromium.org/1848813005\n\nCr-Commit-Position: refs/heads/master@{#386785}","insertions":1,"deletions":176,"churn":177,"filepaths":{"content/browser/frame_host/navigation_controller_impl_browsertest.cc":{"insertions":0,"deletions":146},"content/renderer/history_controller.cc":{"insertions":1,"deletions":30}}},"fb6eeb6dde866fbe9b48b62311eb6cc48771fc70":{"commit":"fb6eeb6dde866fbe9b48b62311eb6cc48771fc70","author":"creis","email":"creis@chromium.org","date":"2016-05-10 15:01:51 -0400","message":"Kill renderer if it changes the main frame's origin on subframe commits.\n\nThis is hopefully safe after the fix for 597322.

I want to eliminate that fake interface in favor of just having our code talk directly to ChromeClientImpl, but that means a dependency on webkit/glue, so I needed to use ChromiumBridge.  Long-term, I'd like to propose changes upstream to HostWindow and ChromeClient to avoid this usage of ChromiumBridge.\n\nThe most impactful part of this CL is the change to move the enumeration of cursor types from WebCursor to PlatformCursor.  This means that WebCursor consumers no longer have access to the type enumeration.  I replaced that with helper functions on WebCursor.  I think the result not only achieves the goal of breaking CursorChromium's dependency on webkit/glue but is also much cleaner.\n\nR=iyengar,eseidel\nReview URL: http://codereview.chromium.org/9072\n\ngit-svn-id: svn://svn.chromium.org/chrome/trunk/src@4846 0039d316-1c4b-4281-b951-d872f2087c98","insertions":533,"deletions":540,"churn":1073,"filepaths":{"chrome/browser/render_widget_host_view_win.cc":{"insertions":17,"deletions":15},"chrome/browser/render_widget_host_view_win.h":{"insertions":4,"deletions":4},"chrome/common/ipc_message_utils.cc":{"insertions":75,"deletions":0},"chrome/common/ipc_message_utils.h":{"insertions":4,"deletions":10},"chrome/common/render_messages_internal.h":{"insertions":2,"deletions":3},"webkit/build/glue/glue.vcproj":{"insertions":0,"deletions":4},"webkit/glue/SConscript":{"insertions":0,"deletions":1},"webkit/glue/chrome_client_impl.cc":{"insertions":5,"deletions":2},"webkit/glue/chrome_client_impl.h":{"insertions":3,"deletions":8},"webkit/glue/chromium_bridge_impl.cc":{"insertions":0,"deletions":40},"webkit/glue/plugins/webplugin_delegate_impl.cc":{"insertions":32,"deletions":9},"webkit/glue/plugins/webplugin_delegate_impl.h":{"insertions":4,"deletions":0},"webkit/glue/webcursor.cc":{"insertions":147,"deletions":58},"webkit/glue/webcursor.h":{"insertions":112,"deletions":51},"webkit/glue/webcursor_win.cc":{"insertions":0,"deletions":203},"webkit/glue/webplugin_impl.cc":{"insertions":4,"deletions":7},"webkit/port/page/chromium/ChromeClientChromium.h":{"insertions":3,"deletions":0},"webkit/port/platform/chromium/ChromiumBridge.h":{"insertions":1,"deletions":6},"webkit/port/platform/chromium/CursorChromium.cpp":{"insertions":80,"deletions":46},"webkit/port/platform/chromium/PlatformCursor.h":{"insertions":11,"deletions":69},"webkit/port/platform/chromium/WidgetChromium.cpp":{"insertions":28,"deletions":3},"webkit/tools/test_shell/test_webview_delegate.cc":{"insertions":1,"deletions":1}}},"39b7b06790a776ee2247f391b1b2e3af1a335503":{"commit":"39b7b06790a776ee2247f391b1b2e3af1a335503","author":"jam@chromium.org","email":"jam@chromium.org@0039d316-1c4b-4281-b951-d872f2087c98","date":"2009-02-03 22:15:58 -0500","message":"Make it easier/less work/less error-prone to create new IPC channel types (i.e. renderer/plugin).Instead of having each message file include the internal one several times with different ifdefs, move that logic to ipc_message_macros.h.  Also make the message class starting IDs come from an enum to ensure we don't use a value twice.  I simplified the logging code a bit so we don't need X_messages.cc files.Clean up places that we were doing manual packing/unpacking.  Most of this was in the automation code.  I added a few new template functions to make it convenient to read the parameters from a message, and updated the code to use them.I also removed unnecessary includes of render/plugin_messages.h from headers to speed up compiling.I moved the traits of IPC structs beside the struct definition to make it more apparent what's going on, so we avoid people modifying the struct and forgetting to update

change moves information about HSTS preloaded and public key pinning, that\nwere previously written in code, into external files that can be consumed by\nother programs. Those files are converted by a program (that is not part of the\nbuild process) into hsts_preloaded.h.\n\nIn order to make this change easier to review, hsts_preloaded.h was created by\nconcatenating public_key_hashes.h and transport_security_state.cc.

For reference, the spec can be found at:\n    https://svgwg.org/svg2-draft/single-page.html#painting-BufferedRendering\n\nThe buffered-rendering hint causes our implementation to create a temporary image buffer\nfor caching an element's foreground rendering. This behavior has been designed to support\nother graphical and container elements in followup patches (such as the use and g elements).\nThis patch should not affect rendering, and a test has been added showing the image\nresults are unchanged. \n\nThe performance aspects of this patch can be tested using the following test:\n    http://philbit.com/bouncingTigers.html\nWithout the patch, rendering is below 1fps. With the patch, rendering is fluid.\n\nTests: svg/css/buffered-rendering.html\n       svg/repaint/buffered-rendering-dynamic-image.html\n       svg/repaint/buffered-rendering-static-image.html\n\nOther than the changes to RenderSVGImage and SVGRenderingContext, the changes below are to\nsupport the new buffered-rendering property:\n\n* css/CSSComputedStyleDeclaration.cpp:\n(WebCore::CSSComputedStyleDeclaration::getPropertyCSSValue):\n* css/CSSPrimitiveValueMappings.h:\n(WebCore::CSSPrimitiveValue::CSSPrimitiveValue):\n(WebCore):\n(WebCore::CSSPrimitiveValue::operator EBufferedRendering):\n* css/CSSProperty.cpp:\n(WebCore::CSSProperty::isInheritedProperty):\n* css/SVGCSSComputedStyleDeclaration.cpp:\n(WebCore::CSSComputedStyleDeclaration::getSVGPropertyCSSValue):\n* css/SVGCSSParser.cpp:\n(WebCore::CSSParser::parseSVGValue):\n* css/SVGCSSPropertyNames.in:\n* css/SVGCSSStyleSelector.cpp:\n(WebCore::StyleResolver::applySVGProperty):\n* css/SVGCSSValueKeywords.in:\n* rendering/style/SVGRenderStyle.cpp:\n(WebCore::SVGRenderStyle::diff):\n* rendering/style/SVGRenderStyle.h:\n(WebCore::SVGRenderStyle::initialBufferedRendering):\n(WebCore::SVGRenderStyle::setBufferedRendering):\n(WebCore::SVGRenderStyle::bufferedRendering):\n(WebCore::SVGRenderStyle::setBitDefaults):\n* rendering/style/SVGRenderStyleDefs.h:\n* rendering/svg/RenderSVGImage.cpp:\n(WebCore::RenderSVGImage::paint):\n\n    The foreground painting has been extracted out into a separate function.

calling the method\nResourceProvider::PrepareSendReturnsToChild(). This is problematic\nbecause we want to return resources immediately if the last reference\non the resource is released when a parent compositor gives the resource\nback to us.\n\nTextureMailboxes deal with this gracefully by using a ReleaseCallback\nin the ResourceProvider that is called when the mailbox is no longer in\nuse. We follow this example to release resources back to child\ncompositors by introducing a ReturnCallback in the ResourceProvider.\nThe ReturnCallback receives an array of resources instead of a single\nresource per call, allowing us to save on post tasks and Run()\ninvocations.\n\nThe PrepareSendReturnsToChild is completely replaced by the new callback\nmechanism. Resources are returned when they are no longer in use in the\ncurrent frame, and their exported reference count reaches zero (or lost\nif the child compositor's connection is destroyed).\n\nWhen the DelegatedRendererLayerImpl recieves a new frame, it will always\nadd all the resources into the ResourceProvider so that it can map the\nresource ids correctly into its own compositor's namespace. Then it will\ndecide if the frame is valid or not. At that point, the DRLI must decide\nto use the new frame, or continue using the old frame. It does this by\ncalling DeclareUsedResourcesFromChild() on the provider. Any resource\nnot listed in the declaration will become unused and returned to the\nchild as soon as possible. This changes the contract on ResourceProvider\nsuch that every call to ReceiveFromChild() should be followed by a\nDeclareUsedResourcesFromChild() call.\n\nFor now, DelegatedRendererLayer receives the callbacks about returned\nresources and just inserts them in its list of resources for the\nembedder to grab via TakeUnusedResourcesForChildCompositor(). A\nfollow-up step will be to move this callback out into the embedder\nitself, similar to ReleaseCallback for mailboxes, so that the\nRenderWidgetHostViewAura can promptly return resources instead of\nwaiting until the next commit to know resources are available.\n\nSince resources are now returned to the main thread during commit, we\nno longer have an extra pending frame of resources sitting on the impl\nside, and can eliminate all the TODOs in our unit tests about this.\n\nCovered by our many existing tests, but also added some new ones:\nResourceProviderTest.DeleteExportedResources\nResourceProviderTest.DestroyChildWithExportedResources\n\nR=piman\nBUG=263069\n\nReview URL: https://chromiumcodereview.appspot.com/24078024\n\ngit-svn-id: svn://svn.chromium.org/chrome/trunk/src@224640 0039d316-1c4b-4281-b951-d872f2087c98","insertions":346,"deletions":771,"churn":1117,"filepaths":{"cc/layers/delegated_renderer_layer.cc":{"insertions":6,"deletions":34},"cc/layers/delegated_renderer_layer.h":{"insertions":2,"deletions":15},"cc/layers/delegated_renderer_layer_impl.cc":{"insertions":43,"deletions":25},"cc/layers/delegated_renderer_layer_impl.h":{"insertions":7,"deletions":7},"cc/resources/resource_provider.cc":{"insertions":100,"deletions":240},"cc/resources/resource_provider.h":{"insertions":10,"deletions":25},"cc/resources/resource_provider_unittest.cc":{"insertions":38,"deletions":279},"cc/resources/return_callback.h":{"insertions":0,"deletions":17},"cc/test/fake_delegated_renderer_layer_impl.cc":{"insertions":2,"deletions":13},"cc/test/fake_delegated_renderer_layer_impl.h":{"insertions":3,"deletions":1},"cc/test/layer_tree_test.h":{"insertions":0,"deletions":3},"cc/trees/layer_tree_host_unittest_delegated.cc":{"insertions":131,"deletions":94},"cc/trees/single_thread_proxy.cc":{"insertions":4,"deletions":18}}},"52f9e0e38c0d5997f34327741b1e9df83896f6aa]":{},"8405686e41b020a757f63703c402baaf4d1f6dd7":{"commit":"8405686e41b020a757f63703c402baaf4d1f6dd7","author":"jochen@chromium.org","email":"jochen@chromium.org@bbb929c8-8fbe-4397-9dbb-9b2b20218538","date":"2013-12-18 06:54:05 -0500","message":"[webdatabase] protect access to m_terminationRequested with a mutex\n\nIt's accessed from the main and the database thread.\n\nBUG=328393\nR=abarth@chromium.org\n\nReview URL: https://codereview.chromium.org/110883012\n\ngit-svn-id: svn://svn.chromium.org/blink/trunk@164083 bbb929c8-8fbe-4397-9dbb-9b2b20218538","insertions":1,"deletions":15,"churn":16,"filepaths":{"third_party/WebKit/Source/modules/webdatabase/DatabaseThread.cpp":{"insertions":1,"deletions":12},"third_party/WebKit/Source/modules/webdatabase/DatabaseThread.h":{"insertions":0,"deletions":3}}},"2f3f80738ee187b90210da07f34d4e2a8ff24c03":{"commit":"2f3f80738ee187b90210da07f34d4e2a8ff24c03","author":"wjia@chromium.org","email":"wjia@chromium.org@0039d316-1c4b-4281-b951-d872f2087c98","date":"2013-03-11 18:41:17 -0400","message":"Use multiple shared memory buffers cyclically for audio capture.\n\nCurrently, only one buffer of shared memory (10ms) is used to transfer captured audio data from browser process to renderer process.

21:17:49 -0400","message":"V8AbstractEventListener should hold a ScriptState\n\n- Basically, this CL replaces V8AbstractEventListener::m_world with V8AbstractEventListener::m_scriptState.\n\n- This CL uses the ScriptState in a lot of places about event listeners and cleans up the code (for example, this CL removes an empty creation context from toV8()).\n\n- The complicated part is that V8LazyEventListener does not know the ScriptState when it's created. Thus, V8AbstractEventListener::m_scriptState can be null if the listener is a V8LazyEventListener until the V8LazyEventListener is called back from Blink (i.e., either of handleEvent(), callListenerFunction() and getEventListener() is called).\n\n- This CL changes web-exposed behavior. In a case where the frame that registered an onload event handler (say Frame1) is different from the frame that triggers the onload event (Frame2), before this CL, the onload event handler is invoked in the context of Frame2. After this CL, the onload event handler is not triggered if Frame1 != Frame2. This behavior is not speced but aligns with Firefox.

Reclones are _completly_\n        avoided for animations now - the SVGAnim*Element classes already updated the instances of an element manually, though that resulted in a reclone\n        nontheless, and thus killing performance. <use> elements can only be recloned through mutations of the elements that they reference to.\n        For example referencing a <rect> element from a <use> element and scripting the <rect> element (setAttribute, or child tree mutations etc.).\n        We reclone instead of trying to synchronize trees - as it's currenty implemented - because it's very hard to do it right.\n\n        Any DOM / SVG DOM / CSS change on the <use> element don't reclone the tree anymore, this is a huge speed benefit.\n        x/y attribute changes are correctly handled in the render tree now (by an additional local transformation), now percentual values work\n        as expected, and resize on window changes - affecting lots of testcases.\n\n        The <use> implementation is much safer now, not doing any mutations synchronously from svgAttributeChanged etc.\n        Remove hack to force garbage collection on SVGElementInstance destruction - can't reproduce it anymore.\n\n        * Android.mk: Add new files to build.\n        * GNUmakefile.am: Ditto.\n        * WebCore.gypi: Ditto.\n        * WebCore.pro: Ditto.\n        * WebCore.vcproj/WebCore.vcproj: Ditto.\n        * WebCore.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj: Ditto.\n        * rendering/RenderSVGShadowTreeRootContainer.cpp: Added.

This initial implementation is close in\nappearance to the legacy display of alt-text but will ultimately move closer to\nthe one seen in Firefox and described in http://hixie.ch/specs/alttext.\n\nThe alt-text and broken-image icon is now rendered as:\n\n    <style>\n        #alttext-container {\n        overflow: hidden;\n        border: 1px solid silver;\n        padding: 1px;          \n        display: inline-block;        \n        }                                 \n        #alttext { display: none; overflow: hidden;}\n    </style>                                    \n    <div id=&quotalttext-container&quot>                  \n        <img src=&quotdata:png, [broken-image-icon]&quot width=&quot16&quot height=&quot16&quot align=&quotleft&quot style=&quotmargin: 0px&quot>\n        <div id=&quotalt-text&quot>Alt text in here</div>         \n    </div>                                                  \n\nSome notes on the way the fallback content is now rendered: \n\n    - The fallback content is rendered inside an inline-block so it does not calculate \n      its dimensions the way a replaced element (i.e. an image) would (as defined by\n      http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visudet.html#inline-replaced-width). So where one of width \n      or height is auto but the other is not, the fallback content will not exactly match \n      the dimensions calculated by RenderImage in error mode currently. We do a modest\n      imitation of the logic in quirks mode, but in strict mode it will behave exactly like an inline-block.\n\n    - Where the image has no src attribute and no alt attribute RenderImage.cpp\n      still looks after the painting of the element - no fallback content is generated\n      and no broken image is displayed. This is consistent with existing behaviour.\n\n    - The only image resource requests that still use the synchronous load path are\n      those where the item is cached (and didn't error out), \n      where its the fallback image for an object element, or where it's the image \n      for a main resource load. All other image loads are now asynchronous so that\n      fallback content can be loaded outside the style recalc phase.\n\n\n    - Instead of aborting an image resource request when the src element is empty\n      (i.e. src='') we now allow the request to go through so that it can fail and\n      invoke the fallback content in HTMLImageLoader.cpp.   \n\n    - As you can see in the new result for fast/borders/rtl-border-05.html, since\n      the alt-text is displayed as an inline-block it no longer artificially shrinks\n      any border on the element to the broken-image icon.   \n\nSome notes on the rebaselined test results:                 \n\n    - I've modified inspector/network/network-image-404.html to output the state of\n      both the resource requests, i.e. the failed one and the resource request for the\n      data:png to display the broken image icon.            \n\n    - I've added a missing support file for fast/css/counters/complex-before.html -\n      its absence meant that the result was polluted by the behaviour of broken image\n      rendering.                                            \n\n    - Likewise for fast/images/imagemap-polygon* tests - our new rendering of failed\n      image loads was interfering with an assumption in the tests that a broken image\n      still painted a RenderImage. So I've removed the src attribute to allow the\n      assumption hold (img elements without a src attribute are painted by\n      RenderImage).\n\n    - I have altered fast/forms/state-restore-to-non-edited-controls.html to wait \n      100ms before submitting the form as the image load in the input element is now \n      asynchronous. Likewise for fast/forms/basic-buttons.html.\n\n    - I did the same to svg/canvas/canvas-draw-image-globalalpha.html and \n      fast/canvas/canvas-drawImage-out-of-bounds-src.html. Since all image loads that\n      might need alt content are performed asynchronously canvas.drawImage() now needs\n      to ensure the content has loaded before drawing.\n\n    - http/tests/security/local-image-from-remote-whitelisted.html has been masking\n      a bug - blink does not load the image even though it is whitelisted. I am\n      rebaselining the test to reflect the failure revealed by this CL and tracking \n      a fix under crbug.com/410949.                         \n\n    - As the alt text is now always exposed if the image doesn't load, any input elements\n      that use an image will show the default alt title 'Submit'. This shows up in\n      the accessibility unit tests in content_browsertests. I plan to rebaseline these\n      in a separate CL.\n\nCommitted: https://src.chromium.org/viewvc/blink?view=rev&revision=185847\n\nReview URL: https://codereview.chromium.org/481753002\n\ngit-svn-id:

without\nhaving to worry about conflicting with the singleton.\n\nThe teardown sequence of the AudioManager and its thread has been cleaned\nup significantly and I don't think it has been completely tested before as\nthe audio thread was terminated before all objects that belonged to the\nthread had a chance to do cleanup.  The AudioManager unit tests do not use\nthe actual audio thread, so this part seems to have been left out.\n\nIn Chrome, the AudioManager instance is now owned by BrowserProcessImpl\nand always constructed on the UI thread.  This instance is then shared\nin the same way that several other 'manager' type objects are shared to\n'content' code, via content::ResourceContext.  Audio specific classes\ndo though receive a direct pointer to the AudioManager and are required\nto do proper reference counting if they need to hold onto the instance.\nI chose to use the ResourceContext rather than direct use of g_browser_process\nto avoid requiring another singleton when writing relatively simple tests\nthat touch the AudioManager.\n\nI added a couple of safeguards to guard against future regressions:\n- Not more than one instance of the AudioManager should be created.\n- The AudioManager should not be addrefed by its own thread.  This\n  can basically become a circular reference and prevent deterministic\n  shutdown.\n\nReviewers:  Of course you're free to review everything,\nbut here's the breakdown in terms of the bare minimum from\nthe standpoint of &quotOwners approval&quot.  I'm asking Henrik to be the\nmain reviewer of the entire patch (sorry!).\n\nHenrik: Everything minus the below, but it would be great if you could\n        take a look at the whole thing, specifically media/audio.\n\nPawel:  I'd like you to take a generic look at this approach.\n        The key areas as far as the singleton itself goes are in\n        media/audio/audio_manager[_base].* and\n        chrome/browser/browser_process*.*\n\nSatish: content/browser/speech/*\n        media/audio/audio_manager_base.* (new reference counting code)\n\nAndrew: content/browser/renderer_host/media/*\n        content/renderer/media/webrtc_audio_device_unittest.cc (Owner)\n\nAvi:    content/browser/renderer_host/render_process_host_impl.cc\n        content/browser/resource_context.*\n\nWilliam: chrome/browser/profiles/profile_io_data.cc\n\t chrome/browser/browser_process*.*\n\nRobert:  This is basically a heads up. I hope that I didn't break the OpenBSD\n         implementation, but unfortunately I have no way of knowing for sure.\n\nShijing: Please take a look at AudioManagerLinux.
