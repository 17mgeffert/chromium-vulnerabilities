vulnerabilities_description: |
  These vulnerabilities have been reported and confirmed by the Chromium team. Chromium typically releases this data on their [release blog](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/).

  Each vulnerability is given **upvotes** by our curators. Upvotes are an entirely subjective measure of how interesting the story each curator finds the vulnerability. Everyone is encouraged to contribute upvotes to vulnerabilities!
